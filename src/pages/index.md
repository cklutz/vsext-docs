## Visual Studio Extensibility

Extensions are add-ons that allow you to customize and enhance your experience in Visual Studio by adding new features or integrating existing tools. An extension can range in all levels of complexity, but its main purpose is to increase your productivity and cater to your workflow. There are thousands of extensions already available in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) for you to download and you can also create your own and upload them to share with other developers.
