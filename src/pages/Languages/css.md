## Auto-completion
Visual Studio [IntelliSense](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532997) is always up-to-date with the latest web standards. You get accurate hints for classes, IDs and attribute names and values, which can sometimes be hard to remember.

Vendor-specific selectors and properties are supported for `-moz-*`, `-ms-*`, `-o-*` and `-webkit-*`.

To invoke a snippet, simply hit the `Tab` key after the property name.

## Working with colors
The color picker is an IntelliSense feature that makes it easy to deal with colors. Use the eyedropper to pick colors from other windows, set the opacity, or choose from previously used colors.

the built-in file picker that automatically helps you insert file
paths into CSS documents.

## Hierarchical indentation
Keep your CSS file nice and organized using hierarchical indentation. The indentation of the CSS rulesets is based on the cascading order of the selectors. To format the document just press `Ctrl+K+D`.
